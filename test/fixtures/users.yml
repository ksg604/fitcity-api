# This model initially had no columns defined. If you add columns to the
# model remove the "{}" from the fixture names and add the columns immediately
# below each fixture, per the syntax in the comments below
#

# Fixtures automatically loaded onto test database when tests are run

one: 
  email: testuser1@test.ca
  password_digest: SecurePassword1234!
# column: value

two: 
  email: testuser2@test.ca
  password_digest: SecurePassword1234!
